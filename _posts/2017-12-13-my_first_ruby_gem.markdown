I was quite intimidated by this assignment (CLI Data Gem Project) due to the newness of it, but more importantly, due to the lack of tests.  I have enjoyed all the labs up until now because I just code to the test.  It made everything much simpler.  To start a project without tests (and not knowing how to write those tests for myself) was very overwhelming.  I also was unsure of whether to start the project in the Learn IDE or to try and setup my own environment.  This actually costs me several days of attempts and failure. Finally, I chose to use the IDE.  

My gem is pretty basic.  It scrapes the charlottenc.gov website for rezoning petitions.  Through the CLI the user can search and get more information using the petition number, petitioner, or district.  I had much higher hopes for the breadth of this gem.  I wanted to be able to scrape multiple years as well as search the descriptions.  I know that I can do these things, but it takes time.

When starting this project, I also worried that it was too narrow in scope since it just deals with Charlotte, NC.  However, when searching online for help in setting up my gem, I found a very helpful video (https://youtu.be/gXgjPEB2j2Y). The video was helpful for step-by-step instruction, but it also had the same idea - making a gem to convert city information to ruby objects.  The gem in the video converts Chicago employee information into ruby Employee objects with attributes. It helped to know that I was not the only one that started with a city (before we take over the world!) 

Part of wanting to learn to code for me is so that perhaps I can help myself or others navigate the world which is so dominated by data.  We have access to so much data, but what do we need to know?  How can we find it easily and more importantly, when we need to know it?  Maybe one day I'll be able to make an app that makes Charlotte, NC a easy place to navigate.
