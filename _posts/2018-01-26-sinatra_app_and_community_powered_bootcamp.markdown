# The Good, the Bad, and the Unknown

This experiece - the community bootcamp, learning to code - has reaffirmed a belief of mine: "Knowledge is Power." (~ Francis Bacon according to a quick google search).  The knowledge I speak of is not that of code though, it is what is to come and what will be expected of you.  A few weeks back  when I hit the first portfolio project - a ruby gem - I was dumbfounded.  I floundered for a couple of days just trying to figure out what I would try to build.  I spent many hours doubting if I could build something from scratch.  You see, I don't know how the inperson bootcamp does it or how the online bootcamp folks feel, but as a community bootcamper I am going through the curriculum at my own pace, feeling pretty good, having all the projects set up for me in the great Learn IDE.  I had no idea if I could just set up the basics because I had not tried it.  I didn't have to do it.  But then that gem project came along and I had to complete it. On my own.  So, I did.  

That project taught me not only that I could do it, but that I should expect, even in the community bootcamp, these portfolio projects every once in a while.  This time, as I was going through Rack and Sinatra labs, I had in the back of my mind that I was going to hit a point where the lab stated: "Build a Sinatra App. See you when you are done."  With that knowledge, I paid closer attention to the gemfiles and environment.rb files that were provided for my labs.  I started thinking early on about what type of web app I would like to try to build when the time came.  In fact, the idea for my web app, Taming the Teens - a web-based chore chart, came to me in the middle of the night a week or more before I got to the porfolio lab in the curriculum.  So, when I got to the lab, I did not have to bounce around ideas of what to do.  I didn't even really question if I could do it.  I just did it. 

All that doing and succeeding is definitely the good about learning to code using Learn's curriculum. Now, here is the bad about the community powered bootcamp:  I have no idea if I did a good job.  I think I did an awesome job.  I mean, it works! However, what I mean by good is 1. Did I put in enough? 2. Was it what they were looking for when they wrote the curriculum. 3. Could I talk about it knowledgably and refactor it with another developer.  I think so, but I will never really know.  The unknown is the only real bad I see in the community powered bootcamp.  

The excellent thing is that this unknown will eventually become known (and therefore, power) as I grow as a coder and interact with more code and more developers.  I must say, I'm looking forward to it!
